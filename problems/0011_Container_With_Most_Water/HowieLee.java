/**
 * Container With Most Water
 *
 * Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai).
 * n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0).
 * Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
 *
 * Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.
