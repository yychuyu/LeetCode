public class PalindromeNumber {

    /*
    Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

    Example 1:

    Input: 121
    Output: true
    Example 2:

    Input: -121
    Output: false
    Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
    Example 3:

    Input: 10
    Output: false
    Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
    Follow up:
    Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

    翻译：判断是否为回文数字
